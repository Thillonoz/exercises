Make a program to checksum a message and verify the checksummed message using
CRC according to the requirements below.
  
Requirements 

1. The message is an N -element array of type uint8_t . 
2. The minimum length of the message is 1 byte. 
3. The maximum length of the message is 14 bytes. 
4. The CRC-15 polynomial is 0xC599 (1100010110011001) 
5. The message is processed from the first element to the last element in the array 
6. Each element of the message is processed from the LSB to the MSB
7. Use the bitwise operators and avoid having magic numbers!
