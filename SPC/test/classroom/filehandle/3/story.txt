Jesper and Casper lay bundled in blankets on the couch, 
each clutching a cup of hot tea. They’d both caught the flu and were too dizzy to play their usual video games.
"Hey," Jesper whispered, his voice barely above a croak, "let's make a plan to prank Mr. Soufien when we’re back."
Casper grinned weakly, imagining their teacher's reaction.
They doodled elaborate sketches of fake spiders and hidden sound devices on scrap paper between sips of tea.
Just then, Casper sneezed loudly, sending papers flying.
They laughed, which quickly turned into coughs, but for a moment,
they were only two conspirators plotting from under thick blankets.
